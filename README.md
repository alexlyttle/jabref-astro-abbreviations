# Jabref journal name abbreviations for astronomy

Many journals require you to submit references with abbreviated journal names, the style of which may vary from journal to journal.

Fortunately, Jabref_ provides an easy means of toggling your Bibtex catalogue journal entries between full and abbreviated form (`Tools -> Abbreviate journal names`).

It's also possible to use your own custom list of journal abbreviations (`Options -> Manage journal abbreviations`). Since I couldn't find any ready made lists of abbreviations for astronomers, I created this repository. Currently I've only provided an incomplete list of abbreviations in the MNRAS style, but this will grow over time, hopefully with the help of fellow astronomers.

I recommend that you maintain a 'long-form' bib file containing all your references with full-length journal names, and only make a copy for conversion to abbreviated form when you are actually submitting a paper. That way you prevent any risk of corrupting your reference catalogue through mishaps.

## MNRAS Citation Style

MNRAS require that journal names be in 'initials only' form for frequently cited journals ([see here](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/pages/General_Instructions#6.3%20References%20and%20citations)) otherwise use the [IAU standard abbreviations](http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/abbreviations/)
